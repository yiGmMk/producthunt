# ADR: Agentic AI Detection and Response

ADR (Agentic AI Detection and Response) is an enterprise security system for AI agents. It helps organizations secure employee-facing agents such as Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, as well as customer-facing agents such as AI support agents.

ADR is **deployed in production at Uber**, and the accompanying paper was accepted to **MLSys 2026**: [Paper PDF](docs/adr-paper.pdf) · [Slides PDF](docs/adr-mlsys-2026-slides.pdf)

## How ADR secures enterprise AI agents

ADR secures enterprise AI agents through four complementary capabilities: observing agent activity, evaluating defenses, detecting threats, and preventing unsafe actions.

1. **ADR Observability: Understand what AI agents are doing and why.** In production, ADR captures agent intent, tool use, and execution traces across 7+ AI coding tools on macOS, Linux, and Windows, as well as internal automation and customer-facing support agents.
2. **ADR Benchmark: Test agent security under realistic enterprise conditions.** ADR-Bench includes 300+ tasks, 133 MCP servers, and coverage of all 17 agent attack techniques.
3. **ADR Detection: Detect risky agent behavior efficiently.** Its two-tier architecture combines high-recall triage with deeper agentic reasoning for suspicious sessions.
4. **ADR Prevention: Stop unsafe actions before they cause harm.** This component is not included in the current open-source release. **Stay tuned.**

## Repository layout

This repository contains the open-source **ADR Sensor**, **ADR-Bench**, and **ADR Detector** described in the paper. The offline **ADR Explorer** engine, which hardens ADR Detection through pre-deployment red teaming, is not included here.

## Quick start: ADR Detection

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uber/ADR
cd ADR/Detection
uv sync
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..." OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

Default detector is `adr` (ADR dual-agent). For keyless smoke tests, use `--detector llamafirewall` (see [Detection/README.md](Detection/README.md)).

See **[docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md)** for the full evaluation workflow (inflate packed benchmark → run detectors → plot figures).

Component documentation:

- [Sensor/README.md](Sensor/README.md): telemetry collection and unified schema
- [Detection/README.md](Detection/README.md): ADR-Bench, detector baselines, MCP infrastructure
