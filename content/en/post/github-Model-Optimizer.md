______________________________________________________________________

**NVIDIA Model Optimizer** (referred to as **Model Optimizer**, or **ModelOpt**) is a library comprising state-of-the-art model optimization [techniques](#techniques) including quantization, pruning, Neural Architecture Search (NAS), distillation, speculative decoding and sparsity to accelerate models.

**[Input]** Model Optimizer currently supports inputs of a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) or [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) model.

**[Optimize]** Model Optimizer provides Python APIs for users to easily compose the above model optimization techniques and export an optimized quantized checkpoint.
Model Optimizer is also integrated with [NVIDIA Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge), [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) and [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) for training required inference optimization techniques.

**[Export for deployment]** Seamlessly integrated within the NVIDIA AI software ecosystem, the quantized checkpoint generated from Model Optimizer is ready for deployment in downstream inference frameworks like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/quantization), [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT), or [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). The unified Hugging Face export API now supports both transformers and diffusers models.

## Deprecation Policy

Model Optimizer follows a structured approach to managing deprecated features:

- **Communication:** Deprecation notices are documented in the [Changelog](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/reference/0_changelog.html). Deprecated items include source code statements indicating deprecation timing, with runtime warnings issued upon use.
- **Migration Period:** Since Model Optimizer is still pre-1.0, we provide a 1-release (~1-month) migration period after deprecation. During this window, deprecated features continue functioning while issuing warnings.
- **Scope:** The policy addresses both complete deprecations (entire APIs removed) and partial ones (specific parameters removed while methods remain).
- **Removal:** Following the migration period, deprecated elements are removed in alignment with semantic versioning standards, potentially including breaking changes in minor version updates while Model Optimizer remains in 0.x.
