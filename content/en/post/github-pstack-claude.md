# pstack

Lauren Tan's [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) is an opinionated Cursor skill stack that improves agent outcomes. This is a port for Claude Code, Codex, Pi and other agent harnesses. It tracks upstream and also carries named policy forks, each declared in [`tools/forks.json`](tools/forks.json).

Tell `poteto-mode` your goal and it will invoke the correct workflow for the task. It keeps your code concise, simple and verified.

For concurrency bugs and invariants that tests cannot reach, see the separate [agent-formal-verify](https://github.com/michael-denyer/agent-formal-verify) plugin, which adds TLA+ model checking and Lean proofs.

## Install

### Claude Code

Run in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
/plugin install pstack@pstack-claude
```

### Codex

Run in your terminal:

```shell
codex plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
codex plugin add pstack@pstack-claude
```

### Pi

Run in your terminal:

```shell
pi install git:github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude
```

The package loads the skills and the pstack Pi extension, which adds the subagent, question, and wake-up tools the skills use, plus `/loop` and the routing instruction. Invoke a skill with `/skill:<name>`.

Run `setup-pstack` to change model defaults, set a reasoning effort per role (for example `arena runners: opus @xhigh, fable @max`, which Claude Code dispatches through the plugin's `pstack:effort-<level>` or `pstack:poteto-agent-<level>` agents; roles without a level keep the session's effort unless the sheet's `default effort` line names one), or turn automatic routing off. The plugin installs the routing hook on Claude Code and Codex; Codex asks you to trust it through `/hooks` before it runs. On Pi the extension injects the same routing instruction. In Claude Code, use `/pstack:setup-pstack`.

For Prime Agent, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or skills-only installs for any harness, see [shared installation](docs/reference.md#shared-skills-installation).

## Getting started

```text
Use poteto-mode to fix the search filter resetting when I change pages.
```

For a bug, it reproduces the failure, uses `how` and `why` to investigate, delegates the fix, then reruns the failing case. If the fix crosses a function boundary, it brings in `architect` before implementation. You receive the fix and the failing and passing evidence.

[Other playbooks](plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md#playbooks) cover planning, features, refactoring, performance issues, investigations, prototypes, PR maintenance, shipping, and longer projects.

![poteto-mode on Claude Code, Codex, and Pi turns a request into verified work. Choose a playbook, plan and delegate with architect, arena, or swarm, then review and verify with interrogate, tests, and measurements. Project playbooks customize the workflow, and setup-pstack configures the model and reasoning effort per role. Supporting skills include how, why, and unslop.](assets/pstack-overview.png)

## Data handling

pstack has no server or telemetry. Anything its skills ask your agent to read, including session transcripts, goes to your model provider. Scripts run locally, and PR tools use your GitHub CLI login.
