# security-audit

A coding-agent skill that turns your agent into a security auditor. It orchestrates isolated agents through reconnaissance, coverage-led hunting, candidate validation, structured output, independent record verification, and target-neutral reporting.

This is the skill that seeded Cloudflare's vulnerability discovery harness, described in [Build your own vulnerability harness](https://blog.cloudflare.com/build-your-own-vulnerability-harness). The harness grew into a multi-stage, fleet-wide system; this skill is the single-repo starting point it evolved from.

## What it does

The skill runs a structured audit in six phases:

1. **Reconnaissance** -- map architecture, trust boundaries, input surfaces, prior evidence, and deterministic coverage in `architecture.md` and `coverage-ledger.json`.
2. **Coverage-led hunting** -- assign isolated hunters from ledger units, record their checks, and use coverage critics to find gaps.
3. **Candidate validation** -- give every unique candidate to a fresh verifier that tries to disprove it.
4. **Structured output** -- write `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, and `rejected` records to `findings.json` and validate them against `report-schema.json`.
5. **Independent record verification** -- fresh agents verify final source claims. Material replacements receive another independent verifier.
6. **Target-neutral reporting** -- derive `REPORT.md`, `FINDINGS-DETAIL.md`, and `NEEDS-VALIDATION.md` from the verified records and coverage ledger.

The parent runs `validate-coverage-ledger.cjs` after creating the ledger and after each later ledger update. It runs `validate-findings.cjs` in Phase 4 and again after every Phase 5 replacement.

The verdicts are distinct: `confirmed` has a complete source trace and bounded observed result, `needs_validation` has an exact unresolved fact and no severity, and `rejected` records a disproved candidate.

Multiple runs against the same repo are additive. The skill uses prior ledgers and findings to target gaps, revalidate changed source, and carry forward current-source evidence without treating stale or unresolved work as covered.

## Installation

Install the skill with the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill \
  --skill security-audit
```

Use `--global` for a user-level installation:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill \
  --skill security-audit \
  --global
```

Run `npx skills --help` for agent-selection and non-interactive options.

## Usage

Start your coding agent in (or pointed at) the codebase you want to audit, then ask it to do a security audit:

```
security audit this codebase
```

```
find security vulnerabilities in ./src
```

```
do a security review, output to ~/audits/my-project
```

The skill activates automatically when the request matches its trigger (security audit, find vulnerabilities, pen-test the code, etc.). A direct codebase audit or pen-test request uses full audit mode. Security questions and focused vulnerability work use guidance mode unless you request report artifacts. In full audit mode, an unspecified output directory defaults to `~/security-audit-skill/<repo-name>/run-<N>`. The workflow writes inside the target repository only when you explicitly select a directory that version control ignores.

## Requirements

- A coding agent with a model that supports tool use and parallel sub-agents
- Node.js for the zero-dependency findings and coverage-ledger validators
- An OS-enforced sandbox for target-controlled builds, tests, processes, browsers, emulators, fuzzers, and fixtures. It must disable external networking, use a sanitized allowlisted environment, enforce resource limits, and allow writes only to assigned scratch paths. Without these controls, the workflow keeps the lead as `needs_validation` instead of executing target code.

## Design principles

- **Only confirm established boundary failures.** Keep a source-grounded blocked lead as `needs_validation` with its exact unresolved fact.
- **Adversarial validation.** The agent that checks a finding is never the agent that found it.
- **Severity requires impact.** Likelihood x impact, not deviation from a checklist.
- **Defense-in-depth gaps are not vulnerabilities.** If Layer A prevents the attack, the absence of Layer B is a hardening note.
- **Multiple runs improve coverage.** In our test runs, a single run found roughly half of the vulnerabilities that repeated runs found in total.
