# Needle 2

Needle 2 is an open 45M-parameter model for tool calling, device use and structured extraction. The whole model is a single 14MB binary that runs a full session in about 28MB of RAM. It is built on our Simple Attention Network findings, compressed to CQ2-bit with Cactus Quants, and baked into its own engine. On the benchmarks below, Needle 2 trades wins with other small models like FunctionGemma 270M, LFM2.5 230M and Apple FM, at 5x to 70x smaller, and 2 bits against their f16.

This repository is the Python package: inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and export. `pip install cactus-needle`, describe your tools, and call them from Python. The inference engine is fetched once from Hugging Face and cached; there is nothing else to build, and offline setup for air gapped devices is covered in [doc/apis.md](doc/apis.md).

- **Self-contained**: weights baked into a single 14MB engine; no separate model files to manage, and inference does no network.
- **Simple contract**: tool calls come back as structured data, text in, JSON out; a byte-level grammar compiled from your schemas constrains every token.
- **Confidence-gated**: every response carries a calibrated confidence score from a learned head; set a threshold, act above it, escalate below it.
- **Tool retrieval**: declare a large catalogue and a built-in retrieval head renders only the top five tools per turn, with the grammar constrained to that subset.
- **Bounded memory**: a 256-token sliding window with the tools pinned as KV sinks, so total memory stays near 28MB no matter how long the conversation runs.

## Simple Attention Network

Needle 2 is a Simple Attention Network, our dense small-model recipe: a Hadamard MLP in place of the FFN, GQA attention, engram key-value memory, and multi-lane hyper-connections. See the paper for the design and ablations: [arXiv:2607.18363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.18363).

![Simple Attention Network architecture](assets/architecture.png)

Each block carries its update rule. Here x̂ is the RMS-normalised flattening of the four residual streams, H the orthonormal Walsh-Hadamard transform (a fixed matrix, applied in n log n time with no weights to read), (kₜ, vₜ) rows gathered from hashed n-gram tables, and P the doubly-stochastic normalisation of the routing logits A, computed by Sinkhorn iteration; a, b, g and all σ-gates are learned and input-dependent. Both attention and MLP residuals are sandwich-normed and gated, the engram sites fire at two layers, and decoding is constrained by a byte-level grammar compiled from the declared schemas.

## Quickstart

```sh
pip install cactus-needle
```

Needle reads your tool descriptions to decide what to call and how to fill arguments, so describing them well is the whole game.

**Simple**: decorate a function. The signature gives the argument types, the docstring is the tool description, and `run()` completes the loop: model picks the call, Needle executes your function, feeds the result back, and returns the final response with the executed tool results attached as `results`.

```python
import needle

@needle.tool
def get_weather(city: str):
    "Get the current weather for a city."
    return {"city": city, "temp_c": 27, "sky": "clear"}

agent = needle.Needle(tools=[get_weather])
print(agent.run("what's it like in Lagos right now?")["results"])
# [{'city': 'Lagos', 'temp_c': 27, 'sky': 'clear'}]
```

**Extraction**: to pull structured data out of text, declare the shape and call `extract()`. Pass a Pydantic model and you get a typed object back.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Invoice(BaseModel):
    vendor: str
    total: float
    due_date: str

invoice = needle.extract("Invoice from Acme Corp, $1,200.00, due 2026-09-01", Invoice)
print(invoice.vendor, invoice.total)   # -> Acme Corp 1200.0
```

Per argument descriptions and choices, value constraints compiled into the decode grammar, raw JSON schemas, driving the loop with `complete()`, the response contract, system facts, tool retrieval, and confidence gating are all covered in [doc/apis.md](doc/apis.md).

## Playground

Try any model in the browser: pick a preset, edit the tools or prompt, and Run. Follow-up queries continue the same conversation.

```sh
needle playground                      # base model, http://127.0.0.1:7860
needle playground --weights my.cact    # a tuned model
```

The server downloads and initializes the model before serving, so the first query is instant. The **Finetune on these tools** button runs the fine-tuning pipeline below from the UI and hands back a downloadable `.cact`.

## Fine-tuning

Needle fine-tunes with LoRA on the frozen base and merges the adapter at export, so a run is cheap and the tuned model is still a single `.cact` that runs on the same engine. The workflow is: (optionally) synthesize data, LoRA fine-tune, then build a tuned `.cact`. See [doc/finetuning.md](doc/finetuning.md) for dataset sizing, reading the loss curve, and troubleshooting.

**Data format.** A JSONL file, one example per line. `reasoning` is optional; an off-topic example has `answers: []`.

```json
{"query": "dim the kitchen to 10", "tools": [{"name": "set_lights", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"room": {"type": "string"}, "brightness": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["room"]}}], "answers": [{"name": "set_lights", "arguments": {"room": "kitchen", "brightness": 10}}], "reasoning": "'kitchen' -> room; 'dim to 10' -> brightness 10"}
```

**1. Synthesize data (optional).** Needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Seed from a tool schema file, or expand an existing set:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
needle generate-data --tools my_tools.json --num-samples 500 --output data.jsonl
needle generate-data --augment data.jsonl --num-samples 500      # expand an existing JSONL
```

Set `OPENROUTER_URL` to use an OpenAI-compatible gateway instead of the default OpenRouter endpoint.

**2. LoRA fine-tune.** The base checkpoint auto-downloads from Hugging Face if you do not pass `--checkpoint`. `--generate N` first synthesizes N more examples from the tools in your data (also needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

```sh
needle finetune data.jsonl --epochs 10
needle finetune data.jsonl --epochs 10 --generate 300 --lora-rank 16 --lora-alpha 32
```

Key options: `--epochs` (default 3), `--lora-rank` (16), `--lora-alpha` (32), `--lr` (1e-4), `--batch-size` (16), `--max-len` (1024), `--val-split` (0.1), `--checkpoint <base.pkl>`, `--out <adapter.pkl>`. The adapter is written to `checkpoints/needle_lora.pkl`. A validation loss prints each epoch from the held out split.

Training is plain JAX and runs on any accelerator jax supports. On an NVIDIA machine install the CUDA build and the same command trains on the GPU:

```sh
pip install "cactus-needle[gpu]"
```

On Apple Silicon the `metal` extra trains on the GPU:

```sh
pip install "cactus-needle[metal]"
```

**3. Build a tuned `.cact`.** Merge the adapter into the base and quantize. The base auto-downloads if absent.

```sh
needle build checkpoints/needle2.pkl --lora checkpoints/needle_lora.pkl --out my_needle.cact
```

Add `--bits 2` for a smaller model (by default the export follows the checkpoint's declared per-layer bit map, falling back to 4 when the checkpoint declares none), or set `NEEDLE_HF_REPO=<you>/<model>` and pass `--upload` to publish the `.cact`. The counterpart `needle download <you>/<model>/my_needle.cact` pulls a published archive on any machine.

**4. Run it.** The engine is weights-agnostic, so a tuned `.cact` runs on it directly - no recompilation:

```python
import needle
agent = needle.Needle(weights="my_needle.cact", tools=[...])
agent.run("...")
```
