# Munder Difflin

### Agent harness to run an office of your clones

**Free, open source and performant** — a multi-agent harness that works with the
subscriptions you already pay for, on their hourly limits. It turns the terminal coding CLI
you already run into a clone of you, one that keeps working while you're away and
coordinates a whole office of agents on your own machine.

Wraps [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex,
**xAI Grok**, **Kimi Code**, **Qwen**, **OpenCode**, **Crush**, **pi.dev**, and
**GitHub Copilot CLI** — with bring-your-own keys and local LLMs.
Agents that message, route, and remember, coordinated by **your clone** (Michael) and
visualized as avatars at work on a shared office floor.

## What it is

Munder Difflin is a desktop app that wraps **real terminal-agent CLIs** as fully-capable agents,
wires them into a **hive mind**, and puts **your clone** in charge — Michael, the one agent *you*
talk to in order to get things done. Under the hood it runs the **fastest memory layer in the
world** so every agent remembers what it learns and recalls it instantly.

- **Every terminal is an agent.** Each `claude`, `agy`, `codex`, `grok`, `kimi`, `qwen`, `opencode`, `crush`, `pi`, `copilot`, or custom session runs as a real
  process in a pseudo-terminal (`node-pty`), byte-for-byte authentic, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** Sessions appear as characters on a Pixi.js office floor — they walk
  to stations as they work, and envelopes fly desk-to-desk when they message each other.
- **The hive coordinates them.** Agents read their memory and drain a mailbox; the router moves
  messages between inboxes; the GOD agent adjudicates, assigns, and escalates only when it needs you.
- **Memory that's instant.** A markdown-first memory layer with a semantic recall index means agents
  remember across sessions and recall in milliseconds.

## How it works

```
            you ── talk to ──►  ┌─────────────┐

```

1. **You spawn agents** — each is a normal terminal process (`claude`, `agy`, `codex`, or custom)
   with its own working directory, identity, and provider-specific lifecycle.
2. **Agents collaborate through the hive** — a local git repo of plain files. They write to their own
   `outbox/`; the harness's router delivers into recipients' `inbox/`. No agent ever touches git
   (single-committer design avoids `index.lock` corruption).
3. **The GOD agent runs the floor** — it reads every request, resolves routine ones itself (keeping
   the system fully autonomous), and only escalates *critical* items (spend, destructive ops, scope
   changes) into an approvals queue you act on.
4. **Everything is visible** — you watch avatars move, envelopes fly, and the live terminal stream;
   you can type back into any session, browse its files, and read its git history.

See [`HIVE.md`](./HIVE.md) for the full multi-agent design, [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the
terminal/event plane, and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the visual system.

## Features

**The floor**
- **Every terminal is a real agent.** Claude Code, Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex, xAI Grok, Kimi Code, Qwen, OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev, GitHub Copilot CLI, or a custom command — each in its own `node-pty` PTY, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** A Pixi.js office floor where agents walk to stations, envelopes fly desk to desk, and avatar state reflects real work.
- **A GOD orchestrator you talk to.** It routes tasks, adjudicates traffic, and escalates only what needs a human. Or press **Talk** and run the floor by voice.
- **Per-agent git worktrees.** Optional isolation so parallel agents never collide on branches.

**Memory & coordination**
- **The hive** — per-agent memory, atomic-file mailboxes, a shared blackboard, an append-only event log, single-committer git.
- **Semantic recall** — markdown memory mined into a shared palace, searchable from the UI, with condensation so it doesn't grow forever.
- **Enterprise Knowledge Graph** — your own documents and policies, queryable by any agent.

**Control & safety**
- **Human gates** — spend, scope, and destructive ops escalate to you. Steer mid-run or stop gracefully.
- **Circuit breaker** — a steer → constrain → stop ladder for agents that loop, storm errors, or blow their budget.
- **Budgets & telemetry** — per-agent token budgets, real cost from transcripts, a durable ledger, OTel spans, and a tool waterfall.

**Command Center**
- Kanban tasks with dependencies, scheduled missions + heartbeat, live fleet monitoring, memory search, activity log, and a CI watcher.
- **Skills** — what every agent can already do across Claude Code, OpenCode and Codex, plus a browsable catalog of 227 more with search, filters, install and uninstall.
- **Built-in Monaco IDE** — file tree, editor tabs, save, plus CHANGES · HISTORY · COMPARE git rails with commit graph, diffs, branch compare, and guarded checkout. All fs/git access brokered through main.

**Getting work in and out**
- **Slack & webhooks** — message a channel or POST a webhook; Michael can spawn an ephemeral worker, reply in-thread, and tear it down.
- **Shareable hires + Agent Gallery** — import a role from a `munderdifflin://hire` link; import only pre-fills the form, a human still spawns it. Browse roles at the [Agent Gallery](https://munderdiffl.in/hires/).
- **BYOK keys + local LLMs** — per-provider keys in a write-only secret broker, plus Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM base URLs. Guides: [open models](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-open-models/) · [Mac Mini](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-a-mac-mini/).
- **Auto-update** — new releases download in the background; you click restart, and the notes arrive as a designed page rather than a version number.
- **Prerequisites** — one Settings page showing which supporting tools (uv, git, Node, MemPalace, each agent CLI) you have, what each is for, and a button that asks Michael to install what is missing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: v0.4.4 — Windows agents can finally talk to each other.** On Windows, agents were
> never told they could message one another: the protocol reaches them as a multi-line command
> line, and `cmd.exe` cut it at the first newline. They started, looked healthy, and ignored each
> other forever. If you tried Munder Difflin on Windows and your team just sat there, that was
> this bug. Also fixed: a fresh install now starts its own message router instead of waiting for a
> restart, the setup wizard can be finished, and dark mode is rebuilt for readability. New in this
> release: **Skills**, **Prerequisites**, and release notes that carry their own page.
> **If you're on 0.3.8, update:** that build's usage-limit guard never released the agents it held,
> and it has been removed entirely.
> macOS (signed & notarized), Windows, and Linux builds are on the
> [releases page](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/releases/latest).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**.
- **Node.js 18+** and npm.
- A **C/C++ toolchain** for `node-pty`'s native addon — on macOS, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- At least one supported agent CLI on your `PATH` — **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**
  (`claude`, the default), **Antigravity** (`agy`), **OpenAI Codex** (`codex`), **xAI Grok** (`grok`),
  **Kimi Code** (`kimi`), **Qwen** (`qwen`), **OpenCode** (`opencode`), **Crush** (`crush`),
  **pi.dev** (`pi`), or **GitHub Copilot** (`copilot`). Most missing CLIs self-heal: the harness runs the installer in the
  terminal and continues into the new binary.
- *Optional:* **your own API keys and local LLMs** in **Settings → AI Engines** (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM).
- *Optional:* the semantic memory index for instant cross-session recall — markdown memory works without it.

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # postinstall rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI
npm run dev        # launches the Electron app with hot reload
```

On first launch you'll go through the onboarding wizard, then land on the floor. Use **Add agent** to
spawn your first session — the GOD agent seats itself in Michael's office automatically.

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build      # production build via electron-vite
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run typecheck  # type-check the node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
```

> If `node-pty` fails to load after an Electron upgrade, re-run `npm install` (the `postinstall` hook
> runs `electron-rebuild` against the current Electron ABI).

## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│   │ (Pixi.js)        │    │ Files + Git tabs (xterm.js)  │    │
│   └─────────▲────────┘    └────────────▲─────────────────┘    │
│             │ avatar state             │ pty bytes / fs / git  │
└─────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
              │ IPC (contextBridge: window.cth)
       ┌──────┴──────────┐        ┌──────┴─────────────┐
       │  Event Plane    │        │  Terminal Plane    │
       │  hooks / hive   │        │  node-pty PTYs     │
       │  router + GOD   │        │  + fs + git        │
       └────────▲────────┘        └──────▲─────────────┘
                │ hook payloads          │ stdin / stdout
                └─────────┬──────────────┘
                   ┌──────┴──────────────┐
                   │ claude / agy / codex│
                   └─────────────────────┘
```

- **Terminal plane.** The main process owns a `PtyManager` that spawns each agent as a `node-pty`
  process and streams output over per-id IPC (`pty:data:<id>`). The renderer talks only through a
  typed `window.cth` bridge ([`src/preload/index.ts`](./src/preload/index.ts)), which also exposes
  sandboxed filesystem and git helpers.
- **Hive / event plane.** `hive.ts` is the on-disk multi-agent layer; `hooks.ts` runs the hook
  server that provider bridges POST lifecycle payloads to (`cth-hook` for Claude Code, `agy-hook`
  for Antigravity). `memory.ts` wraps the semantic memory CLI. The router delivers messages, drains
  provider outboxes, the GOD agent adjudicates, and idle/inbox wakeups keep workers draining mail.

<div align="right">(<a href="#munder-difflin">↑ back to top</a>)</div>

## Design system

The aesthetic is **Animal Crossing × Earthbound × SNES menu UI** — pixel-snapped, chunky, friendly.
[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) is canonical; every component derives from its tokens. The Munder Difflin
brand layers a **Dunder-Mifflin maroon** (`#6E1423`) and **gold** (`#F4D35E`) on top for logo and
chrome. The 15 avatars are the cast of *The Office*, differentiated by hair/skin/shirt recipes.

## Roadmap

Shipped through **v0.4.3** — ten agent engines with BYOK keys and local LLMs, voice orchestration,
the hive (memory · mailboxes · blackboard · event log), Command Center with kanban and schedules,
a built-in Monaco IDE with git rails, integrations registry + secret broker, Slack-spawned workers,
shareable hires and the Agent Gallery, observability and the circuit breaker, durable persistence,
session resume, multi-window floors, and working auto-update.
Full history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

Next up:

- [ ] **More chat integrations** — Telegram and richer chat bridges that pipe a channel into Michael's queue and route replies back out.
- [ ] **More engines & integration templates** — keep growing the engine roster and the integrations registry.
- [ ] **Fuller avatar coverage** — drive the remaining station visits and tool-bubbles entirely from real hook events.
- [ ] **Durable layout & command history** — extend persistence to agent layout and per-session history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — this is an early prototype with a lot of surface area. Start with
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: fork, `npm install && npm run dev`, keep
`npm run typecheck` green, and **derive any new UI from [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) tokens**. Good
first areas: wiring real hook events, the add-agent flow, the config drawer, and cross-platform work.

Questions, bugs, or want to show off your office? Join the Discord: **<https://discord.gg/SEDzP5ZPk5>**. Add your Discord handle to a PR and you'll get the `employee of the month` role when it merges.

## Telemetry

Official builds send a **small set of anonymous usage events** (app opened, agent spawned, feature
used) — never prompts, code, file paths, or agent output. The complete event list, the anonymity
guarantees, and the three ways to opt out (Settings toggle, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, or building from
source — forks compile with no key and send nothing) are documented in
[`TELEMETRY.md`](./TELEMETRY.md).
