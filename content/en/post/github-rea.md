See a feature in an app that you want in your own product? Ask your agent to investigate it with REA. It can inspect the app without its source code, explain how the feature works, show the evidence, and build a version for your project.

REA connects your agent to tools for inspecting native binaries, JavaScript and Electron apps, .NET assemblies, and websites. You can also use the same tools from your terminal. Analysis runs locally, and results include the evidence and limitations behind each conclusion.

Setup registers REA with your agent and installs matching workflow instructions. Native analysis can use an existing Hopper or Ghidra installation; setup can optionally install Hopper with approval. Static JavaScript analysis needs neither engine.

> **[Visit the REA website](https://morluto.github.io/rea/)** for setup instructions, illustrated guides, and real case studies.

## Quick start

### Set up your agent

With Node.js and npm installed, run:

```bash
npx rea-agents setup
```

Choose your agents, review the proposed changes, and approve them. Setup adds
REA's MCP server and matching workflow instructions, with backups of existing
configuration. Restart your agent afterward.

Setup supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and
[other agents](docs/installation.md#supported-agents). See
[installation and setup](docs/installation.md) for provider configuration and
manual MCP registration.

### Ask your agent

```text
Understand how search works in the Notes app, show me the evidence, and build a
similar feature for my project.
```

Replace Notes with your target app and the feature you want to understand.

### Use the terminal

Inspect an extracted JavaScript/Electron app directory or ASAR:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

The result includes modules, imports, Electron boundaries and their evidence.
Replace the path with your target, such as `"D:/apps/example"` on Windows.

To install the `rea` command for regular use:

```bash
npm install --global rea-agents
rea --help
```

For native analysis, configure a provider first. See the
[CLI and Evidence guide](docs/cli.md) for native commands, provider selection,
snapshots and scripting.

### Update REA

REA changes quickly, and new releases include frequent bug fixes. Keep your
installation up to date.

For an npm-installed CLI:

```bash
rea update
```

To refresh your agent registrations and skill, run the setup command printed
by the update.

If you use `npx`, update your agent setup with:

```bash
npx rea-agents@latest setup
```

Review the setup changes and restart your agent. For one-off CLI commands,
use `npx rea-agents@latest` followed by the command.

## How REA works

Your agent calls REA through MCP to inspect the target and trace relevant code.
REA returns findings with their evidence. The agent uses them to ask follow-up
questions, explain the behavior, or write and test an implementation.
CLI commands use the same workflows.

![REA investigation flow: your agent asks about a local target, REA inspects and traces it using analysis tools, and the agent uses the returned code, references and unknowns to explain, implement and test.](website/public/assets/figures/rea-investigation-flow.svg)

## What you can analyze

REA requires Node.js 22.x (>=22.19), 24.x (>=24.11), or 26+, plus npm.
Additional tools and host support depend on the target:

Static JavaScript and .NET inspection read the supplied files without running
the application. Runtime capture runs or interacts with the selected target
using your user permissions; each runtime guide describes its effects.

Native formats and host support vary by provider. See
[Hopper and Ghidra setup](docs/installation.md#hopper), the
[IDA guide](docs/ida-provider.md), and
[experimental Windows Ghidra support](docs/windows-ghidra-p0.md).
Ghidra also supports [16-bit DOS analysis](docs/ghidra-dos.md).
For provider selection, see the [CLI guide](docs/cli.md#choose-a-provider).
Check [release availability](docs/installation.md#released-package-and-main)
for features added since the latest npm release.

## Showcases

### DX-Ball: reconstruct a sound-pan calculation

Follow a sound call into its position-to-pan helper, inspect the instructions,
and turn incomplete pseudocode into C. The reconstruction passes 3,205
original-x86 cases and reproduces all 63 compiled function bytes.

[Reconstruction repository](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/dx-ball)

### Notion: trace the Electron clipboard bridge

Find the renderer's clipboard API, follow it through preload and IPC into the
main process, and inspect the rich clipboard format.

[Read the case study](https://morluto.github.io/rea/showcase/notion/)

### TH04: recover a DOS bullet-ring calculation

Inspect the original PC-98 game's 16-bit instructions, recover the fixed and
aimed angle calculations, and compare the reconstructed C++ with the
historical compiler output.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Which agents can use REA?</strong></summary>

Any agent that supports local MCP servers. Setup configures the
[supported agents](docs/installation.md#supported-agents); other clients can use
[manual MCP registration](docs/installation.md#mcp-registry).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need Hopper, Ghidra or IDA?</strong></summary>

Deep native analysis uses one of them. Static JavaScript and .NET inspection
work without a native analysis engine. Setup can install Hopper after approval;
Ghidra and IDA use your existing installations. See [provider setup](docs/installation.md#hopper).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to start Hopper first?</strong></summary>

REA starts Hopper when an operation needs it. On macOS, a first-run dialog may
ask you to choose demo mode or activate your license. See
[Hopper startup and troubleshooting](docs/installation.md#launcher-paths-and-troubleshooting).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does installing the skill from skills.sh do?</strong></summary>

The skill supplies investigation instructions for your agent. Use `rea setup`
to register REA's MCP server and install the matching instructions, then restart
your agent. See [skill-only installation](docs/installation.md#skill-only-installation).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What code does REA return?</strong></summary>

Native analysis returns pseudocode and assembly. JavaScript/Electron analysis
recovers modules and their relationships. Your agent uses these findings to
write and test an implementation; the [showcases](#showcases) give worked examples.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does REA upload my app?</strong></summary>

REA analyzes targets locally. Your agent receives the tool results, and its
model provider has its own data policy.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I do if I hit a bug?</strong></summary>

Update first; a recent release may already fix it.

For an npm-installed CLI:

```bash
rea update
```

For agent setup through `npx`:

```bash
npx rea-agents@latest setup
```

If you're using an agent, complete the [setup refresh](#update-rea) and restart
it. Retry the same task. If the problem persists, [open an issue](https://github.com/morluto/rea/issues)
with your REA version, target type, steps to reproduce and error output.
