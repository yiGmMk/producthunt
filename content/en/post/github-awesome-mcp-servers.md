## What is MCP?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This list focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

## Clients
