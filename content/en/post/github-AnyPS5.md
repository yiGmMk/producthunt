# [boykopovar/AnyPS5](https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5)

# About

Tool for automatic executables porting to Linux and Windows.

Includes a [relinker](core/relinker) that converts executable to the target system's native format and implementations of [system prx libraries](core/libs/prx) suitable for dynamic linking. No emulation or separate runtime process.

[Usage](docs/user/USAGE.md), [Build instructions](docs/dev/BUILD.md), [Technical debt of the project](docs/dev/TechnicalDebt.md), [code style conventions](docs/dev/CONVENTIONS.md), [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Status

[![libraries](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/badge-libraries.svg)](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/) [![shaders](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/badge-shaders.svg)](https://boykopovar.github.io/AnyPS5/)

[List of verified games](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md)

Dreaming Sarah (2D platformer) runs at a stable 60 fps on a GTX 1050 Ti / i5-7500 3.4GHz.

Unsupported or unexpected states strictly throw `std::runtime_error`. `what()` is printed to stderr and the process terminates.

The [shader recompiler](core/shader/recompiler/Recompiler.cpp) successfully produces SPIR-V (validated via [Spirv-Tools](3rdparty/SPIRV-Tools) when built with `ANYPS5_ENABLE_SPIRV_TOOLS`).

## Compatibility

See the [game compatibility list](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested games and known issues.

## Input mapping

SDL-mapped game controllers are supported, including analog sticks and triggers. Keyboard and mouse controls can be configured with an `anyps5-input.ini` file. See [input mapping](docs/user/INPUT_MAPPING.md) for the supported devices and configuration format.
